# This text file describes the commands necessary for running an assembler.

# The lines following 'Short read assembly commands' describe the assembly of
# paired-end short reads. The lines following 'Hybrid assembly commands'
# describe the assembly of hybrid read sets. The lines following 'Final
# assembly files' are the filenames of the end product(s) of assembly.

# The commands will be executed with 'SHORT_READS_1', 'SHORT_READS_2' and
# 'LONG_READS' replaced as appropriate.

# This file applies to SPAdes around v3.5 - after hybridSPAdes was added but before the graph changed.

# Short read assembly commands

# Hybrid assembly commands
spades.py -1 SHORT_READS_1 -2 SHORT_READS_2 --nanopore LONG_READS -o output --careful --threads 8

# Final assembly files
