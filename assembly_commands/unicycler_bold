# This text file describes the commands necessary for running an assembler.

# The lines following 'Short read assembly commands' describe the assembly of
# paired-end short reads. The lines following 'Hybrid assembly commands'
# describe the assembly of hybrid read sets. The lines following 'Final
# assembly files' are the filenames of the end product(s) of assembly.

# The commands will be executed with 'SHORT_READS_1', 'SHORT_READS_2' and
# 'LONG_READS' replaced as appropriate.
